# Simple Approach of TDM-ASK Algorithms

A simple approch of Time Division Multiplexation (TDM) and Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK-OOK) algoritms, developed in C++, with the objetive of keep C++ skills refined.

# Libraries

- iostream
- math
- algorithm
- vector

# Parameters and Use

The default parameters are for ASK, and they are commented in the code, the code also returns an one column .txt file named "Modulation_Output.txt" with values of voltage in Volts.

Also TDM implementation is made only for 3 input signals.
